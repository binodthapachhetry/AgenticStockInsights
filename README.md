# AgenticStockInsights
A Multi-Agent, Containerized Framework for Real-Time Stock Analysis &amp; Decision-Making

1. Introduction
	•	Project Name: AgenticStockInsights
	•	Project Description: A multi-agent, containerized framework for real-time stock analysis and decision-making, leveraging specialized language model agents to fetch, analyze, and summarize financial data to generate actionable insights for short-term trading decisions.
	•	Project Goal: To create a scalable, modular, and efficient system that can ingest, process, and analyze financial data in real-time, enabling users to make informed trading decisions based on up-to-date information.
    •	Project Scope: The project will focus on developing a set of specialized agents that can perform various tasks related to financial data analysis, such as summarization, sentiment analysis, semantic search, Q&A, and analytics. The agents will be designed to work together in a microservice-based architecture, allowing for easy scalability and deployment on cloud platforms like GCP.

2. Project Overview
	•	Description:
A brief explanation of the project’s goal: a real-time financial analysis system that leverages specialized language model agents to fetch, analyze, and summarize financial data (SEC filings, news, etc.) to generate actionable insights for short-term trading decisions.
	•	Key Features:
	•	Real-time data ingestion and processing
	•	Modular, microservice-based architecture
	•	Specialized agents for summarization, sentiment analysis, semantic search, Q&A, and analytics
	•	Scalable deployment on GCP (GKE, Cloud Run, Pub/Sub)
    •	Integration with financial data sources (SEC EDGAR APIs, yfinance, etc.)
	•	Use of advanced language models (FinBERT, BART/GPT, embedding models) for analysis
    •	Orchestration using LangChain to coordinate workflow between agents
    •	Elasticsearch/OpenSearch for efficient data storage and retrieval
    •	REST API for interacting with the system
	•	Example Use Cases:
	•	Real-time analysis of SEC filings to identify potential investment opportunities
	•	Sentiment analysis of news articles to gauge market sentiment
	•	Semantic search to find relevant financial documents
	•	Q&A to answer specific questions about financial data
	•	Analytics to generate insights and reports
    •	Example Workflow:
	•	Data Ingestor fetches SEC filings and news articles
	•	Summarization agent generates summaries of the documents
	•	Sentiment agent analyzes the sentiment of the summaries
	•	Semantic Search agent indexes the summaries for efficient retrieval
	•	Q&A agent answers questions based on the indexed summaries
	•	Analytics agent generates insights and reports based on the data
	•	Orchestrator agent coordinates the workflow between the agents
    •	REST API allows users to interact with the system and retrieve the results of the analysis
    •	Example API Endpoints:
	•	POST /api/analyze: Analyze a list of SEC filings and news articles
	•	GET /api/summaries: Retrieve the summaries of the analyzed documents
	•	GET /api/sentiment: Retrieve the sentiment analysis of the analyzed documents
	•	GET /api/search: Search for relevant financial documents
	•	GET /api/qa: Answer specific questions about financial data
	•	GET /api/analytics: Generate insights and reports based on the data (Note: This is a placeholder for the actual API endpoints and may change based on the final design of the system.)

3. Architecture Diagram
	•	Include a high-level diagram (you can embed an image or link to a diagram file) that shows how the agents (Orchestrator, Data Ingestor, Summarization, Sentiment, Semantic Search, Q&A, Analytics) interact.
    •	Diagram should show the flow of data from ingestion to analysis and retrieval.
    •	Diagram should also show the interaction between the agents and the REST API.
    •	Diagram should include the following components:
	•	Orchestrator agent
	•	Data Ingestor agent
	•	Summarization agent
	•	Sentiment agent
	•	Semantic Search agent
	•	Q&A agent
	•	Analytics agent
	•	REST API
	•	Data storage (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch)
	•	Message broker (Google Cloud Pub/Sub)
	•	Infrastructure (Docker, Kubernetes (GKE) / Cloud Run)
    •	Other relevant components (e.g., ML models, data sources, etc.)


4. Technologies Used
	•	Languages & Frameworks: Python, FastAPI
	•	ML & NLP Models: FinBERT, BART/GPT, embedding models like all-MiniLM-L6-v2
	•	Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes (GKE) / Cloud Run, Google Cloud Pub/Sub, Elasticsearch/OpenSearch
	•	Other: LangChain (for orchestration), yfinance, SEC EDGAR APIs, etc.
