- Add basic error handling and retries

### Cloud Storage Integration
- Create Cloud Storage buckets for raw data
- Modify Data Ingestor to store raw data in Cloud Storage
- Implement basic data versioning

### Scheduled Collection
- Set up Cloud Scheduler for twice-daily data collection
- Create simple Cloud Function to trigger data collection
- Implement basic logging for collection jobs

## Phase 3: Data Processing Pipeline (Week 5-6)

### Pub/Sub Integration
- Replace Kafka with Google Cloud Pub/Sub
- Set up topics for different data types (SEC filings, stock prices)
- Implement basic message handling in each agent

### Basic Analytics
- Implement simple stock metrics calculation
- Create basic sentiment analysis pipeline
- Set up document summarization workflow

### Data Storage
- Set up Firestore collections for processed data
- Implement basic query capabilities
- Create simple data access patterns

## Phase 4: API Layer & Basic Frontend (Week 7-8)

### API Gateway
- Set up Cloud Endpoints or API Gateway
- Create unified API for all agent services
- Implement basic rate limiting

### Simple Web Frontend
- Create basic React application
- Deploy to Firebase Hosting
- Implement simple stock search and display

### Basic Authentication
- Set up Firebase Authentication
- Implement simple user login/signup
- Create basic user profiles

## Phase 5: Integration & Testing (Week 9-10)

### End-to-End Workflows
- Connect all services through Orchestrator
- Implement complete data flow from collection to presentation
- Create basic error handling across services

### Monitoring Setup
- Set up Cloud Monitoring for basic metrics
- Implement health check endpoints
- Create simple alerting for critical failures

### MVP Testing
- Perform end-to-end testing
- Fix critical issues
- Document known limitations

## MVP Deliverables

1. **Functional Components**
   - Data collection from SEC and Yahoo Finance
   - Basic sentiment analysis of financial news
   - Simple document summarization
   - Question answering about stocks
   - Basic analytics on stock performance

2. **Technical Implementation**
   - All agents deployed on Cloud Run
   - Cloud Scheduler for twice-daily data collection
   - Pub/Sub for inter-service communication
   - Cloud Storage for raw data
   - Firestore for processed data
   - Simple web frontend on Firebase Hosting

3. **User Experience**
   - Search for stocks by ticker
   - View basic stock information and price history
   - See sentiment analysis of recent news
   - Read summaries of SEC filings
   - Ask simple questions about a company

## Development Approach

### Iterative Implementation
- Start with minimal viable versions of each component
- Focus on end-to-end functionality over feature completeness
- Use feature flags to gradually enable capabilities

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for critical components
- Integration tests for service interactions
- Manual testing for end-to-end workflows

### Documentation
- Document API endpoints
- Create simple architecture diagrams
- Maintain deployment instructions

## Next Steps After MVP

1. **Feature Enhancement**
   - More sophisticated analytics
   - Advanced ML models for predictions
   - Enhanced user experience

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Caching strategies
   - Query optimization
   - Resource scaling

3. **Additional Data Sources**
   - Financial news APIs
   - Social media sentiment
   - Economic indicators

This roadmap provides a structured approach to building an MVP that demonstrates the core functionality while leveraging GCP services and maintaining the microservices architecture. The focus is on getting a working system rather than perfection, allowing you to gain hands-on experience with the technologies while creating a foundation for future enhancements.
